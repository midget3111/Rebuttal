# Rebuttal webchat

Rebuttal webchat is a multimedia webchat system featuring text channels and Voice, Webcam and Livestream rooms

## Customisation and Config

### Themes

Rebuttal comes with 3 themes by default and allows extras. To create a theme called `example` you need to create `public/css/example.css` and `public/img/example/...`

### Config

`config.json` contains the most basic options.

### Storage

Rebuttal comes with 2 storage systems, and more are possible but beyond the scope of this readme. JSON storage is easy for testing but completely unsafe as password and messages are stored plaintext.
